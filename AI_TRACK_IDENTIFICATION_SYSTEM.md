# üéØ AI Track Identification System

## What This Does

Your AI now analyzes live audio against your Rekordbox track database (XLF/XML files) to identify what's playing in real-time and enhance its analysis dramatically!

## How It Works

### 1. **Audio Fingerprinting**
- Creates unique "fingerprints" from live audio using:
  - **Spectral Profile**: Frequency distribution and MFCC features
  - **Tempo Profile**: Rhythm patterns and BPM data
  - **Energy Profile**: Loudness and dynamics
  - **Key Profile**: Harmonic content using chroma features

### 2. **Track Matching**
- Compares live audio fingerprints against your track database
- Scoring system based on:
  - **Tempo Match (30%)**: BPM similarity
  - **Key Match (20%)**: Harmonic compatibility  
  - **Energy Match (30%)**: Dynamic level similarity
  - **Spectral Match (20%)**: Genre-based frequency characteristics

### 3. **AI Enhancement**
When a track is identified with high confidence, the AI gets MUCH smarter:
- **Genre Detection**: Uses known track genre instead of guessing
- **Energy Prediction**: Predicts energy based on song structure
- **Beat Prediction**: Enhanced with known track BPM
- **Transition Detection**: Knows when approaching outro/intro
- **Song Position**: Estimates current section (verse/chorus/bridge)

## User Interface

### Track Identification Panel (Bottom Left)
- **üìÅ Load XLF/XML**: Upload your Rekordbox collection
- **üß™ Sample Tracks**: Test with built-in sample tracks
- **Current Track Display**: Shows identified track with confidence %
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Song section, time remaining, predicted energy
- **Alternative Matches**: Shows other possible tracks

### AI Debug Panel (Top Right)
- **üéµ Identified Track**: Currently detected song
- **Track Confidence**: How sure the AI is (0-100%)
- **Song Section**: Current part of the song
- **Enhanced Status**: Shows when AI is using track data

## File Format Support

### Rekordbox XML/XLF Files
Your existing Rekordbox collection exports work perfectly! The system extracts:
- Track metadata (name, artist, BPM, key, genre)
- Beat grid data for timing analysis
- Hot cues and memory cues
- Energy analysis and song structure
- Harmonic compatibility information

## Intelligence Levels
