# üéµ MIDI BPM Detection Usage Guide

## What This Does

Your DDJ-FLX4 Audio Visualizer now has **real-time BPM detection** that reads the tempo directly from MIDI clock signals instead of loading track files. This means:

- ‚úÖ **No need to load tracks** - just start playing music and the visualizer detects BPM automatically
- ‚úÖ **Real-time beat sync** - animations pulse perfectly with your music
- ‚úÖ **Works with any audio source** - vinyl, streaming, CDJs, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Accurate timing** - uses official MIDI clock protocol (24 pulses per beat)

## How It Works

### 1. MIDI Clock Detection
- Your DDJ-FLX4 sends MIDI clock signals (0xF8 status byte) when playing
- The hook counts 24 MIDI clocks = 1 quarter note (standard MIDI timing)
- BPM is calculated using: `BPM = 60000 / beatInterval`

### 2. Beat Phase Tracking
- Tracks where you are within each beat (0-1 scale)
- 0 = start of beat, 0.5 = halfway through beat, 1 = end of beat
- Used for smooth pulsing animations and visual effects

### 3. Smooth BPM Transitions
- Averages the last 4 beat intervals to avoid jumps
- Applies smoothing factor to prevent erratic BPM changes
- Only accepts reasonable BPM values (60-200 BPM)

## Using the New Feature

### Step 1: Toggle to BPM Mode
1. Connect your DDJ-FLX4 via USB
2. Open the app in your browser
3. Look for the **"üéµ Switch to BPM Mode"** button in the control panel
4. Click it to switch from Controller Mode to BPM Mode

### Step 2: Start Playing Music
1. Load a track on your DDJ-FLX4 (any deck)
2. Press **PLAY** on the controller
3. The app will automatically detect MIDI clock signals
4. Watch the visualizer sync perfectly with your music!

### Step 3: Monitor the Detection
- **BPM Display**: Shows current detected BPM in real-time
- **Beat Phase**: Shows percentage progress through current beat
- **Connection Status**: Green = connected, Red = disconnected
- **Console Logging**: Open F12 ‚Üí Console to see detailed MIDI data

## What You'll See

### BPM Mode Visualizer Components:
- **üîÆ Pulsing Sphere**: Scales with beat phase, color changes with BPM
- **üìä Beat Cubes**: Flash at different beat subdivisions (1, 2, 4, 8 beats)
- **‚≠ï Beat Circle**: Rotates to show beat progress
- **üì± Live BPM Display**: Shows current BPM and beat phase percentage

### Debug Information:
- All MIDI messages logged to console for troubleshooting
- Connection status updates
- Beat detection events with timing info
- BPM calculation details

## Troubleshooting

### "MIDI Disconnected" Issue:
1. **Check USB Connection**: Make sure DDJ-FLX4 is connected via USB
2. **Power On Controller**: Ensure the controller is powered on
3. **Browser Permissions**: Some browsers require MIDI permissions
4. **Retry Connection**: Use the "Retry Connection" button
5. **Check Console**: Open F12 ‚Üí Console for detailed error messages

### No BPM Detection:
1. **Start Playing**: Make sure a track is actually playing on the DDJ-FLX4
2. **Check MIDI Clock**: Some setups might not send clock signals
3. **Try Different Deck**: Test with both Deck A and Deck B
4. **Check Source**: Make sure you're playing from a source that sends tempo data

### Erratic BPM:
- The system filters out unreasonable values (below 60 or above 200 BPM)
- BPM smoothing prevents sudden jumps
- If still erratic, check if multiple tracks are playing simultaneously

## Technical Details

### Hook Usage in Your Code:
```javascript
const { currentBPM, isConnected, beatPhase } = useMIDIBPM();

// currentBPM: Real-time BPM (60-200 range)
// isConnected: Boolean for connection status  
// beatPhase: 0-1 value showing beat progress
// beatInterval: Milliseconds per beat
// clocksReceived: Number of MIDI clocks received
// lastBeatTime: Timestamp of last detected beat
```

### Integration with Three.js:
- Use `beatPhase` for smooth pulsing animations
- Use `currentBPM` to adjust animation speeds
- Use `beatInterval` for timing calculations
- All timing uses `performance.now()` for accuracy

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- ‚úÖ **Firefox**: Full support  
- ‚ùå **Safari**: Limited Web MIDI support
- ‚ùå **Mobile**: No Web MIDI support

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Basic Setup**: Get BPM detection working first
2. **Experiment with Settings**: Try different tracks and BPM ranges
3. **Customize Visualizations**: Modify the beat-synced components
4. **Add More Effects**: Use the beat timing for additional visual effects

damn dude, this should give you real-time beat detection without needing to load any tracks! Let me know if it works or if you need any adjustments! üéõÔ∏è
